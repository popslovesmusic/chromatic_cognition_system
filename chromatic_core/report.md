# Chromatic Cognition Core — Initial Report

## Build Summary
- Target: CPU-only (Rust 2024 edition)
- Dependencies: ndarray, rayon, serde, serde_json, plotters
- Build command: `cargo build --release`
- Tests: `cargo test`

## Tensor Engine Highlights
- Deterministic tensor initialization via custom linear congruential generator.
- ChromaticTensor implements Add/Sub, display summaries, and JSON serialization.
- Primitive ops (`mix`, `filter`, `complement`, `saturate`) execute in parallel and emit operation logs.
- GradientLayer blends layer certainty into a single visualization plane and exports PNG frames.

## Training & Logging
- `mse_loss` computes CPU MSE over tensor fields and returns summary statistics.
- JSON logs written to `logs/operations.jsonl` and `logs/run.jsonl` for reproducibility.

## Example Output
- `cargo run --example demo` renders `out/frame_0001.png` and appends metrics to `logs/run.jsonl`.
- Demo prints configuration and scalar loss for traceability.

## Performance Notes
- Parallel loops leverage Rayon with contiguous ndarray buffers.
- Tensor statistics reuse shared routines for logging to minimize recomputation.
- Visualization uses Plotters' bitmap backend for dependency-light rendering.

## Latest Validation Updates
- Bridge configuration loader reads deterministic Phase 7A parameters from
  `config/bridge.toml`, validating FFT size, categorical count, and ΔE guard-rails
  before exposing them to the spectral bridge (`src/config.rs`).
- CIE ΔE94 color-difference check enforces the ≤1e-3 reversibility threshold with deterministic D65/2° conversions (`src/spectral/color.rs`).
- Appendix A hue bridge converts ChromaticTensor samples into SpectralTensor frequency
  channels with canonical hue wrapping, circular interpolation, and seam blending that
  preserves round-trip error below 1e-6 radians.
- High-level `ModalityMapper` now wraps the spectral bridge, wiring encode/decode flows
  through the loaded `BridgeConfig` and emitting JSON logs for every tensor conversion
  (`src/bridge/modality_map.rs`).
- Unified Modality Space encoder (`bridge::modality_ums`) now enforces the Chronicle
  2049-bin spectral layout, averages per-bin energy before deterministic 2049→256
  block means, maps hue to [-1,1], seeds the affective channels from Chronicle μ, and
  normalises every component with Chronicle-provided μ/σ while regression tests verify
  aggregation stability and categorical consensus via `map_hue_to_category`.
- Spectral feature extraction now routes all energy and entropy sums through a Q16.48
  fixed-point, Neumaier-compensated reduction tree with explicit round-to-even casting,
  keeping reorder deltas below 0.5 dB across platforms (`src/spectral/accumulate.rs`).
- Phase 5A awareness buffer captures per-cycle coherence, entropy, spectral energy, and gradient RMS for deterministic replay.
- AR(2) predictor delivers bounded two-step forecasts for coherence, entropy, and gradient energy with >0.8 Pearson correlation on synthetic validation traces.
- Phase 5B dissonance scoring detects >90% of injected drifts with <5% false positives and logs cycle-level deltas to `logs/meta_dissonance.jsonl`.
- Reflection planner now generates reversible mitigation plans (SeedFrom → PauseAug) once dissonance exceeds the configurable 0.25 threshold.
- Training examples now populate the `TrainingConfig::retrieval_mode` field and use the current solver signature so `cargo test` builds all binaries without manual fixes.
- The Phase 3B validation scenario performs class-aware dream mixing, captures Δloss feedback into the utility aggregator, and writes the synthesized bias profile to `logs/phase_3b_bias_profile.json`.
- Dream module documentation snippets import `PoolConfig` from the correct module and avoid non-ASCII operators, keeping doctests green.
- Dream pool soft-index rebuild now logs HNSW insertion/build failures before reverting to the linear fallback, preserving actionable diagnostics and resetting the ANN memory multiplier to 1.0 when degradation is required.
- SimpleDreamPool addition paths now share an `internal_add` helper that centralizes
  memory-budget eviction heuristics and entry-id bookkeeping for the canonical
  `[3×12×12×3]` processing unit.
- HNSW eviction logging was trimmed from the hot path; rebuild instrumentation retains
  detailed diagnostics while routine inserts run without repetitive warnings.
- HNSW index now performs incremental inserts, tracks per-metric ghost nodes for
  evicted entries, and rebuilds in place after eviction churn so ANN search stays
  consistent without destroying the graph.

=======
- Index stabilization counters gate ANN/soft invalidation until eviction churn exceeds
  10% of the live pool, resetting immediately after rebuilds to keep retrieval indices
  fresh without thrashing.
>>>>>>> theirs
- Regression suite: `cargo test` exercises 210 unit tests, 7 integration tests, and 27 doctests in ~72s on CPU-only hardware (cold build compile time: 3m27s).
- Detailed execution log captured in `docs/TEST_REPORT.md` with suite durations and reproduction steps.
- Phase 5C ethics filter clips unsafe learning-rate, tint, and augmentation directives, rolls back on violations, and journals every decision to `logs/meta.jsonl`.
- Phase 4 audit: `MemoryBudget` models ANN overhead, `HnswIndex` validates id mappings with deterministic distance clamps, `SimpleDreamPool` falls back to linear search on ANN build errors for safety, and the findings are catalogued with line-level references in `docs/PHASE4_MEMORY_HNSW_AUDIT.md`.
- `Phase5CConfig` exposes adjustable safety bounds (`lr_damp_max`, `cool_tint_max`, `pause_aug_max_steps`, `ethics_hue_jump_deg`) with unit coverage for default and custom parsing.
- Phase 6C continuity controller translates trend slopes into bounded temporal actions, applies cooldown-governed updates to learning rate and dream-pool size, and normalizes phase weights when oscillations emerge.
- `Phase6CConfig` adds cadence and adjustment bounds (`cycle_interval`, `lr_adjust_max`, `dream_pool_expand_max`, `trend_anomaly_cooldown`) for the continuity loop with parsing tests.
- Phase 6D diagnostics normalize trend slopes into a deterministic risk score, feeding a predictive state into continuity planning before heuristics fire.
- `Phase6DConfig` surfaces `[p6d]` thresholds, risk weights, and action delay while unit tests cover default and custom parsing.
- Documentation set expanded with `DIAGNOSTICS_SPEC.md`, Phase 6D validation results, and integration logs capturing pre-emptive actions.
