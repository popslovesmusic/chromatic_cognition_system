# Changelog

All notable changes to Chromatic Cognition Core will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed - ANN Index Stability
- Enabled incremental updates in `HnswIndex` by inserting new embeddings directly
  into existing graphs, persisting vectors for deterministic rebuilds, and
  tracking metric-specific ghost nodes for safe filtering.
- Updated `SimpleDreamPool` eviction handling to preserve the active `HnswIndex`
  instance and refresh it in-place, preventing ANN rebuild thrashing during pool
  churn.

### Fixed - Dream Pool Diagnostics
- Logged HNSW construction failures in `SimpleDreamPool::rebuild_soft_index`, ensuring
  ANN fallback decisions capture actionable error details while reverting to the
  linear index budget settings.
- Unified `SimpleDreamPool` add flows behind `internal_add`, keeping memory-budget
  evictions and index bookkeeping consistent across coherence-aware inserts.
- Removed noisy HNSW eviction-path warnings so hot-path tracing remains clean while
  the ANN rebuild diagnostics retain their detailed instrumentation.
- Added an eviction-threshold counter so ANN/soft indices are only invalidated after
  churn surpasses 10% of the current pool, resetting rebuild markers once indices
  are refreshed.

### Added - Spectral Accumulation Determinism
- Introduced Q16.48 fixed-point accumulator with Neumaier-compensated, fixed tree
  reduction for spectral energy sums.
- Updated FFT feature extraction to rely on deterministic rounding when converting
  accumulated spectra back to `f32`, ensuring platform-stable entropy and band
  energy metrics.

### Added - Hue Continuity Bridge
- Spectral bridge adds deterministic hue normalization, seam blending, and reversible
  ChromaticTensor ↔ SpectralTensor conversion with frequency storage.

### Added - Bridge Configuration Loader
- Introduced `BridgeConfig` parser for deterministic hue ↔ frequency parameters,
  including spectral accumulation and reversibility guard-rails (`src/config.rs`).
- Documented `config/bridge.toml` usage alongside engine configuration in the README.

### Added - Modality Mapper Wrapper
- Added `bridge::ModalityMapper` as a deterministic façade over the spectral bridge,
  exposing encode/decode helpers that respect the loaded `BridgeConfig` and emit
  operation logs for tensor conversions (`src/bridge/modality_map.rs`).
- Re-exported the mapper from the crate root so downstream integrations can request
  chromatic ↔ spectral conversions without touching lower-level seam parameters.

### Added - Unified Modality Space Projection
- Implemented `bridge::modality_ums` with a deterministic 512D Unified Modality Space
  vector that embeds spectral categories, replicated HSL channels, and temporal priors
  normalised by Chronicle statistics.
- Added round-trip helpers (`encode_to_ums`, `decode_from_ums`) and unit coverage to
  validate spectral category normalisation and HSL recovery for Phase 7A integration.

### Changed - Unified Modality Space Projection
- Replaced categorical replication with deterministic 2049→256 spectral downsampling,
  per-channel Chronicle μ/σ normalization, and hue consensus checks via
  `ModalityMapper::map_hue_to_category`.
- Hardened the UMS encoder to require the 2049-bin Chronicle layout, average spectral
  energy before block means, seed the affective prior block from Chronicle μ, and add
  regression tests covering spectral aggregation and fixed block windowing.

### Added - Native Rust Solver

### Added - Phase 5A Awareness & Prediction
- **meta::awareness** - `Awareness` collector with bounded history and deterministic statistics (`observe`).
- **meta::predict** - AR(2) `Predictor` with bounded forecasts for coherence, entropy, and gradient energy.
- **Phase5AConfig** - Parses `[p5a]` sections with horizon and feature set defaults.
- **Config/Docs** - Updated README and engine TOML to expose Phase 5A controls.

### Added - Phase 5C Ethics Filter & Meta-Adapter
- **meta::ethics** - Configurable `EthicsGuard` with clipping verdicts for learning rate, tint, and augmentation controls.
- **meta::adapter** - Deterministic adapter that applies reflection plans, supports rollbacks, and exports `MetaCycleReport`.
- **meta::log** - JSONL meta-journal with ordered sequence numbers and sampling via `log_every`.
- **Phase5CConfig** - Parses `[p5c]` safety bounds (`lr_damp_max`, `cool_tint_max`, `pause_aug_max_steps`, `ethics_hue_jump_deg`).
- **TrainingControls** - Canonical self-regulation state shared with Instinct Kernel integrations.

### Added - Phase 6C Continuity Control
- **meta::continuity** - Temporal regulator translating trend slopes into bounded learning-rate and dream-pool adjustments with cooldowns.
- **Phase6CConfig** - Parses `[p6c]` cadence and action bounds for the continuity loop.

### Added - Phase 6D Predictive Diagnostics
- **meta::diagnostics** - Normalizes trend slopes into deterministic `DiagnosticModel` instances with repeatable risk scoring.
- **Phase6DConfig** - Parses `[p6d]` thresholds and risk weights, keeping actions bounded by continuity limits.
- **Continuity integration** - `plan_temporal_action` now queries Phase 6D before applying heuristic adjustments, enabling damp and reset pre-emption.
- **Documentation** - Added `DIAGNOSTICS_SPEC.md`, validation report, and integration log covering oscillation and drift case studies.

#### Solver Module
- **`Solver` trait** - Interface for chromatic field evaluators
- **`SolverResult`** - Standardized result structure (energy, coherence, violation, gradients)
- **`ChromaticNativeSolver`** - Color-theory-informed metric implementation

#### Color-Space Metrics
- **Energy**: Total variation (spatial smoothness) + saturation penalty
- **Coherence**: Color harmony based on complementary balance and hue consistency
- **Violation**: Gamut clipping, extreme saturation, local discontinuities
- **Gradients**: Analytical derivatives for all metrics (fast, accurate)

#### Color Space Utilities
- `rgb_distance()` - Euclidean distance between RGB colors
- `rgb_saturation()` - Saturation computation (max-min)/max
- `rgb_saturation_gradient()` - Gradient of saturation w.r.t. RGB
- `rgb_to_hsv()` - RGB to hue-saturation-value conversion
- `angle_difference()` - Shortest angular distance between hue angles

#### ChromaticTensor Enhancements
- `get_rgb()` - Access RGB values at specific cell
- `dims()` - Get tensor dimensions (rows, cols, layers)
- `mean_rgb()` - Compute mean RGB across all cells
- `total_cells()` - Get total number of cells
- `rows()`, `cols()`, `layers()` - Dimension accessors

#### Examples
- **solver_demo.rs** - Comprehensive solver demonstration
  - Smooth random fields
  - High contrast patterns (checkerboard)
  - Pure RGB colors (saturation analysis)
  - Out-of-gamut violation detection
  - Gradient computation example

#### Testing
- Unit tests for color space utilities (rgb_distance, rgb_saturation, rgb_to_hsv, angle_difference)
- All tests passing (4/4 solver tests)

### Dependencies
- **anyhow 1.0** - Error handling for solver trait

### Updated
- Synchronized training examples with the new `TrainingConfig::retrieval_mode` field and current solver API for example builds.
- Reworked the Phase 3B validation workflow to perform class-aware dream mixing, accumulate utility feedback, and persist bias profile artifacts.
- Refreshed dream module documentation snippets and removed unused imports to keep doctests compiling without warnings.

### Analysis

#### Dream Pool Specification Evaluation
- **DREAM_POOL_EVALUATION.md** - Pre-implementation assessment
- Evaluated proposed long-term semantic memory system for chromatic tensors
- Analyzed coherence definition (spectral entropy vs. existing color harmony metric)
- Assessed chromatic tokenization (manual hue/saturation vs. embedding-based)
- Implementation complexity: 4800 LOC, 1 month, 8 new dependencies (FFT, NLP, DB)
- **Value proposition concerns:** Unclear use case, unvalidated assumptions
- **Recommendation:** ❌ Defer full implementation
- **Alternative path:** SimpleDreamPool prototype (1 week) → validation → decision gate
- **Identified risks:** Coherence metric collision, high opportunity cost, technical complexity

#### DASE Integration Assessment
- **DASE_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md** - Comprehensive feasibility study
- Analyzed DASE (Discrete Analog Simulation Engine) at `D:\isoG\New-folder\sase_amp_fixed`
- Identified architectural mismatch: DASE is analog circuit simulator, not constraint solver
- Evaluated 4 integration options (IGSOA Adapter, Phase 4B, Native Rust, Hybrid)
- **Recommendation:** Implement native Rust solver for color-space metrics
- Future research opportunity: IGSOA quantum-inspired physics for color reasoning
