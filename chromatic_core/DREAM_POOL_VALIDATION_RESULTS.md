## Results

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Group A (Control) | Group B (Test) | Δ | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|---|-------------|
| **Final Accuracy** | 0.4559 | 0.4559 | 0.0000 | 0.00% |
| **Convergence Epoch** | 0 | 0 | 0 | Same |
| **Total Time (ms)** | 59,809 | 79,929 | +20,120 | **-33.6%** ⚠️ |

### Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Group A | Group B | Δ |
|--------|---------|---------|---|
| **Mean Coherence** | 0.5224 | 0.5148 | -0.0076 |
| **Mean Energy** | 1211.27 | 1241.12 | +29.84 (worse) |

### Pool Statistics (Group B)
- **Dreams Stored:** 500 (at capacity)
- **Pool Mean Coherence:** 0.7277
- **Pool Mean Energy:** 1241.12

---

## Key Observations

### 1. **No Learning Occurred**
Both groups achieved identical validation accuracy (0.4559) at **epoch 0** and remained flat throughout all 40 epochs. This indicates:
- The validation metric (coherence proxy for accuracy) is not correlated with actual classification performance
- The "dream cycle" training loop does not optimize for the classification task
- The solver evaluation does not provide meaningful gradients or updates

### 2. **Retrieval Mechanism Works, But Is Irrelevant**
- Pool successfully accumulated 500 high-coherence dreams (mean coherence 0.7277)
- Cosine similarity retrieval functioned correctly
- **However:** Seeding with retrieved dreams had zero impact because no learning occurred

### 3. **Performance Degradation**
Group B took **33.6% longer** due to:
- Pool lookup overhead
- Tensor blending (3 retrievals × mix operations)
- No offsetting benefit

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did the Experiment Fail?

The validation experiment correctly implemented the specification, but exposed a **critical flaw in the experimental design**:

#### Problem 1: No Training Algorithm
```rust
// Current "training" loop (experiment.rs:169-177)
for _ in 0..self.config.dream_iterations {
    let result = self.solver.evaluate(&current_tensor, false);
    current_tensor = mix(&current_tensor, &sample.tensor);  // ⚠️ No gradient descent!
}
```

The experiment **simulates** training with `mix()` operations, but:
- No loss function is computed against labels
- No gradients are computed or applied
- No parameters are updated
- `mix()` just averages tensors (not learning)

#### Problem 2: Validation Metric Mismatch
```rust
// Validation uses coherence as proxy for accuracy (experiment.rs:243)
fn validate(&mut self, val_samples: &[ColorSample]) -> f64 {
    total_coherence / sample_count as f64  // ⚠️ Not accuracy!
}
```

Coherence measures internal tensor smoothness, **not** classification correctness.

#### Problem 3: Solver Evaluates Structure, Not Task
`ChromaticNativeSolver` computes:
- Energy: Total variation + saturation penalty
- Coherence: Color harmony
- Violation: Out-of-gamut pixels

**None of these metrics relate to the 10-class color classification task.**

## What This Tells Us About Dream Pool

### Valid Conclusions
1. **SimpleDreamPool implementation works correctly**
   - In-memory storage ✓
   - Cosine similarity retrieval ✓
   - Coherence filtering ✓

2. **Retrieval overhead is measurable** (~34% time increase)

3. **High-coherence dreams can be accumulated** (pool mean: 0.73 vs training mean: 0.51)

### Invalid Conclusions
❌ "Dream Pool doesn't help convergence"
→ **No convergence occurred to accelerate**

❌ "Retrieval-based seeding is ineffective"
→ **Cannot test seeding without a learning algorithm**

## Recommendations

### Decision Gate: **DEFER** Dream Pool (Phase 2+)

Per the validation specification's decision gate:
> "If No: The retrieval hypothesis is not validated. Defer or abandon the Dream Pool project in favor of higher-priority solver/GPU work."

### Required Prerequisites Before Retry

To properly validate the retrieval hypothesis, the following must exist:

#### 1. **Implement Real Training Loop**
```rust
// Pseudocode - what's needed
for epoch in 0..num_epochs {
    for (tensor, label) in train_data {
        // Forward pass
        let output = model.forward(&tensor);

        // Compute loss against label
        let loss = cross_entropy(output, label);

        // Backward pass with gradients
        let grads = model.backward(loss);

        // Update parameters
        optimizer.step(grads);
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Build Classification Model**
Options:
- Extend `ChromaticNeuralNetwork` to output 10 class probabilities
- Implement simple MLP on flattened tensor
- Use existing neural module with proper output layer

#### 3. **Use Real Validation Accuracy**
```rust
fn validate(&mut self, val_samples: &[ColorSample]) -> f64 {
    let mut correct = 0;
    for sample in val_samples {
        let predicted = self.model.predict(&sample.tensor);
        if predicted == sample.label {
            correct += 1;
        }
    }
    correct as f64 / val_samples.len() as f64
}
```

#### 4. **Clarify Dream Pool's Role**
The specification is unclear about **how** retrieved dreams should help:
- Seed initial weights? (requires trainable model)
- Pre-train representations? (requires encoder)
- Regularize training? (requires integration into loss)
- Warm-start solver state? (requires stateful solver)

### Alternative Validation Approach

**Option A: Solver Optimization Task**

Instead of classification, test retrieval on the solver's **own objective**:
- Task: Minimize energy + maximize coherence on random tensors
- Seed: Retrieve similar low-energy dreams
- Metric: Solver iterations to reach target energy

**Option B: Regression Task**

Simpler than classification:
- Task: Predict mean RGB from noisy tensor
- Training: MSE loss with gradient descent
- Seed: Retrieve dreams with similar target RGB

### Next Steps

**Path 1: Fix Training Infrastructure (Recommended)**
1. Implement proper gradient descent training
2. Build classification model with loss function
3. Integrate real validation accuracy
4. **THEN** retry Dream Pool validation
