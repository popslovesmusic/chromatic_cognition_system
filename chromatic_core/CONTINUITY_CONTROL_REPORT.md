# Continuity Control Report — Phase 6C

## Overview
Phase 6C introduces a deterministic continuity controller that reads long-horizon trend models and emits bounded temporal actions. The planner reacts to loss drift, coherence collapses, entropy spikes, and oscillation detection while the executor clamps learning-rate and dream-pool adjustments and rebalances phase weights under cooldown supervision.

## Configuration Summary
- **cycle_interval:** 10 cycles between planner evaluations.
- **lr_adjust_max:** ±0.20 multiplicative learning-rate delta.
- **dream_pool_expand_max:** Up to 50 dream slots expanded or contracted per intervention.
- **trend_anomaly_cooldown:** 5-cycle refractory period after each temporal action.

## Validation Checklist
- ✅ Planner outputs respect configured bounds for learning-rate deltas and dream-pool deltas.
- ✅ Executor saturates expansions/contractions and normalizes phase weights.
- ✅ Cooldown prevents repeated adjustments within the configured refractory window.
- ✅ Config parser covers default and custom `[p6c]` overrides via unit tests.

## Runtime Notes
- Continuity loop executes every 10 cycles when the cooldown has elapsed.
- Oscillation detections immediately trigger phase weight resets to maintain stability.
- Learning-rate adjustments apply multiplicatively and never reduce the rate below machine epsilon safeguards.

## Next Steps
- Collect 1,000-cycle validation traces to quantify ≥10% variance reduction and <0.5% mean loss drift.
- Extend reporting to log temporal actions alongside Phase 5C ethics interventions for unified meta telemetry.
