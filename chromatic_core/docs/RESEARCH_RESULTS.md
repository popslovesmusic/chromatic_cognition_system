## Visualizations

The network generates distinct color patterns for each class:

- **Red class (0):** Predominantly red/pink hues
- **Green class (1):** Predominantly green hues
- **Blue class (2):** Predominantly blue hues

Sample predictions show clear color separation in the learned representations.

## Analysis

### Why It Works

1. **Color-Space Alignment:** The task is inherently aligned with color-space operations
2. **Rich Representations:** 4D tensors provide ample capacity for color patterns
3. **Differentiable Operations:** Mix, saturate, and complement operations provide effective gradients
4. **Certainty Weighting:** Learned certainty weights act as attention mechanism

### Network Behavior

The chromatic layers learned to:
- **Amplify discriminative features:** Saturate operation enhanced class-specific colors
- **Filter noise:** Mix operation combined signal across spatial locations
- **Maintain spatial structure:** 2D topology preserved through layers

### Computational Insights

**Operation Gradients:**
- ✅ Mix: Gradients flow evenly, good for feature combination
- ✅ Saturate: Alpha parameter provides learnable non-linearity
- ✅ Complement: Sharp gradients for hue transformation
- ✅ Filter: Selective gradients based on color difference

## Comparison to Traditional Networks

| Aspect | Traditional CNN | Chromatic Network |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Base unit** | Scalar activations | RGB triplets + certainty |
| **Operations** | Conv, ReLU, Pool | Mix, Filter, Saturate, Complement |
| **Color handling** | Treats channels separately | Native color-space operations |
| **Interpretability** | Black box | Visualizable color transformations |
| **Parameters** | Weights + biases | Color tensors + biases |

## Limitations & Future Work
