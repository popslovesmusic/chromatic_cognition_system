# Test Execution Report — Chromatic Cognition Core

## Overview
- **Date (UTC):** 2025-10-28
- **Command:** `cargo test`
- **Environment:** Linux x86_64 (kernel 6.12.13, GCC-compatible toolchain via Rust 1.89.0)
- **Objective:** Validate core tensor operations, dream pipeline, learner training loop, and spectral analysis modules remain deterministic and pass regression coverage.

## Summary of Results
| Suite | Tests | Status | Duration |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| Unit Tests (`src/**/*.rs`) | 121 | ✅ Passed | 11.01 s |
| Integration Tests (`tests/operations.rs`) | 6 | ✅ Passed | 0.00 s |
| Documentation Tests | 20 | ✅ Passed | 36.96 s |

_Total wall-clock elapsed: ~48 s (including build time of 2m14s for first-run compilation)._

## Key Coverage Highlights
- **Tensor Core:** Arithmetic ops (`mix`, `filter`, `complement`, `saturate`) validated for numerical stability, clamping, and deterministic logging.
- **Dream Pipeline:** Diversity, bias synthesis, hybrid scoring, and soft index retrieval modules exercised with deterministic seeds.
- **Learner Module:** Classifier forward/backward passes, loss computation, utility aggregation, and training augmentations verified.
- **Meta Layer:** Ethics guardrails, dissonance detection, adaptive planning, and autoregressive prediction covered through scenario tests.
- **Spectral Analysis:** FFT-based feature extraction and entropy metrics confirmed for empty, uniform, and peaked spectra.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Ensure Rust toolchain is installed (`rustup toolchain install stable`).
2. Clone the repository and enter the project directory.
3. Run `cargo test` (first run recompiles dependencies; expect ~2–3 minutes on cold cache).
4. Subsequent invocations run in <1 minute once build artifacts are cached.

## Artifacts
- Unit test binary: `target/debug/deps/chromatic_cognition_core-<hash>`
- Integration test binary: `target/debug/deps/operations-<hash>`
- Logs: `logs/` directory (JSONL) populated during tensor and dream operations.

## Observations
- No flaky behavior observed; all stochastic components utilize fixed seeds ensuring determinism.
- Doc-tests remain synchronized with API examples in `src/` and `docs/`, preventing drift between documentation and implementation.
- Future optimization opportunity: enable incremental compilation caching in CI to amortize the initial 2m14s build time.
