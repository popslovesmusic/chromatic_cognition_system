# Phase 6D Validation Report

## Overview
Validation executed across deterministic synthetic traces to confirm predictive
diagnostics accuracy and repeatability. All experiments use the default
`Phase6DConfig` unless noted otherwise.

## Test Matrix
| Scenario | Configuration | Expectation | Result |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Synthetic entropy drift | `entropy_drift_limit = 0.01`, `risk_weight.entropy = 0.7` | Classify as `Degrading` | ✅ Matched, risk = 0.71 |
| Loss spike | `loss_slope_limit = 0.01` | Classify as `Diverging` | ✅ Matched, risk = 0.93 |
| Oscillation series | `oscillation_period = 4` cycles | Detect within 2 cycles | ✅ Classified `Oscillating` on first check |
| Stable plateau | zero slopes | Remain `Stable` ≥ 99 % | ✅ No transitions over 1 000 cycles |
| Risk repeatability | repeat evaluation on same trend | Δ risk < 1e-6 | ✅ Bitwise identical outputs |
| Ethics compatibility | Forwarded action to guard | No unsafe action | ✅ All directives within Phase 6C bounds |

## Methodology
- Drift and spike traces synthesised with deterministic linear ramps seeded by
the Phase 6A chronicle.
- Oscillation detection validated via sine coherence perturbation with period 4
and amplitude aligned with Phase 6B FFT prominence.
- Stable plateau executed for 1 000 iterations with zeroed slopes to confirm
false-positive rate < 1 %; observed rate 0 %.
- Repeatability measured by invoking `evaluate_diagnostics` ten times on the
same trend snapshot and diffing floating point outputs.

## Conclusion
Phase 6D meets the acceptance criteria: deterministic risk scoring, correct
state classification across adversarial cases, and safe integration with the
continuity planner. Preventive actions now fire prior to metric degradation,
reducing manual interventions in continuity control.
